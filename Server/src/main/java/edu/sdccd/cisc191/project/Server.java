/**
 * This program is a server that takes connection requests on
 * the port specified by the constant LISTENING_PORT.  When a
 * connection is opened, the program sends the current time to
 * the connected socket.  The program will continue to receive
 * and process connections until it is killed (by a CONTROL-C,
 * for example).  Note that this server processes each connection
 * as it is received, rather than creating a separate thread
 * to process the connection.
